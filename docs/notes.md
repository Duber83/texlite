Note that TeXLite utilises just an essential set of Markdown's syntax/elements, for example horizontal rules aren't used in standard LaTeX and so won't be parsed as anything special in TexLite. Still, TeXLite uses the .md format so you don't have to put in any extra effort to get syntax highlighting in your editor.

<!-- # Install LaTeX engine dependencies
